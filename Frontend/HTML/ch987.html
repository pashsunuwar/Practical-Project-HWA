  <h1>Mange Review: One Piece Chapter 987</h1>
  <br><img src='/Frontend/images/One Piece 987 English Scan_02.jpg'><br>
  
  <p>  A series of memories surfaced, one of which was Oden's slash which successfully injured Kaidou's body in chapter 970. Until finally Kaido shot Oden dead in chapter 972.
Kaidou also remembered Oden's words before dying that his spirit would still live on in his bodyguards even though he was physically dead.
Kaidou's memories appear at the same time the Nine Red Scabbards' attacks hit the body of the strongest being in the One Piece world.
Kin'emon's sword successfully pierced Kaidou's body. Kikunojo managed to stab Kaidou's palm. The two swords that Raizo was holding then went into Kaidou's neck, while Nekomamushi bit Kaidou's arm.

  <em>Yamato & Luffy</em>
  <p>
    Not only the samurai and Kaidou's men who have faced each other.<br>

Yamato and Luffy, who seem very familiar, also take a square to attack Kaidou. They saw Kaidou's position being weak as a result of being beaten up by Nine Red Scabbards.
The appearance of Oden's bodyguards shocked Yamato. He couldn't believe Oden's samurai were really alive.<br>
When Yamato was about to get closer to the location where Kaidou fell, he was immediately intercepted by Ulti. One of the Tobiroppo members was annoyed because in chapter 983, he was beaten by Yamato using the Thunder Bagua technique. 
Not caring about Ulti's scolding, Yamato suddenly emphasized that this was the right moment to become a Kozuki Oden.
This is the umpteenth time Yamato has said that he wants to be Oden or even introduces himself as Oden.<br>
The admiration for Oden's figure really makes Yamato want to leave his true identity and 100 percent turn into Oden.
Not finished with that, Yamato also emphasized that he didn't care about the urgent situation his father was facing.
He declared that he was no longer on the side of Kaidou et al. It doesn't matter if Kaidou dies at the hands of the Nine Red Scabbards.
