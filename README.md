The HWA project will contain languages including:
* Java
  
* Javascript

* MySQL

* HTML

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Specifically, you are required to create a full-stack web application following the Enterprise Architecture Model, using: 

an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
